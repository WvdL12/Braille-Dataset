## OUTDATED
This repository has been moved to https://github.com/WvdL12/BrailleData for future work.

## Sources
Datasets currently expected to be used was sourced from  
* [Ilya Ovodov, Angelina Set](https://github.com/IlyaOvodov/AngelinaDataset)  
* [Kaggle, Braille image set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shanks0465/braille-character-dataset)  
* [DSBI Dataset](https://github.com/yeluo1994/DSBI)  

These datasets contain both Onesided and Twosided Braille documents and characters, with labels. The focus of the project is currently on onesided Braille document translation.  
The data labeling has been standardised from the different datasets. To account for generality, the label system used describes the dots present in a given Braille character, rather than directly translating the character.
